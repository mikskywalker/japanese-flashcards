# Hey there, it's Miks 👋🏻 
### I have recently started with my nihongo class and I wanted to create flashcards to help me memorize the characters. 
#### ..and also because I don't really want to spend money. 😜

##### This is built with React, TS, and Tailwind. 

~ I'll make updates to this soon and add katakana and kanji as well!

cheers
